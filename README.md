## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This app fetches two things:
- **Current weather data** from OpenWeatherMap’s `/weather` endpoint
- **24-hour forecast** (next 6 time slots) from the `/forecast` endpoint

Data is visualized using Streamlit's built-in components like `st.metric()`, `st.line_chart()`, and layout grids like `st.columns()`.

## 🔄 Future Improvements

Here are a few ideas for next versions:
- 🧪 Real-time **AQI & UV Index** (using separate APIs)
- 📍 GPS-based weather (with `geopy`)
- 📆 5-day forecast toggle
- 🌐 Language/Units switch (Celsius ↔️ Fahrenheit)
